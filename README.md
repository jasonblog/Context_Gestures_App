Context_Gestures_App
====================

Android application - Domotic control using a Ninja Block(Beaglebone Black w/ Arduino), recognizes hand gestures with the accelerometer and the current localization using networks intensity.

I used the KNN algorithm for the space localitation and the DTW algorithm(fast-DTW) for the gesture recognition. We need to have csv files with expected data for running the project.
